# Laravel PHP Framework (My starter kit)

Laravel is a great web application framework. I've been using it for many projects. And here's my starter kit for most of my projects with a lot of features :
- Full backend management (admin pages) based on AdminLTE template
- Module creation with a single command
- Imageable models
- Ajax images upload
- Users and settings management

I will update this documentation ASAP.
